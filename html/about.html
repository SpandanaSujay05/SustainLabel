                <h2>Our Work</h2>
                <p>We source eco-friendly materials from local markets, give production work to our collaboration partners, and take the product to the market.</p>
                <p>Our work provides a source of employment and income for communities that are typically not included in the economic streams of society. For example, some repetitive tasks like block printing can be done by people on the autism spectrum that our partner organizations work with, and tailoring or stitching work would be taken by mothers, even though they are not directly employed by the partner organizations.</p>
